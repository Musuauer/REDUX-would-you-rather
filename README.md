# Would You Rather Project

This is the starter code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data.

The web app is a game of choice between two options, showing the total votes of each option and a leader board.

The user can choose to impersonate a character at Sign In, to answer the questions and create new questions, which will be added to the questions lists in the homepage.

The project was made with React and Redux.

Installed Dependencies:

- material-ui
- avataaars
- react-hamburger-menu
- redux-persist
- react-router-dom
- redux-thunk
- styled-components

### To install

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ npm install -or- yarn
    ```
3. Start the server:
    ```sh
    $ npm start -or- yarn start
    ```
4. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Or: To build the app for production to the build folder:

  ```sh
    $ npm run build -or- yarn build
  ```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
By default, the create-react-app includes a service worker in the production build.
